# Air-quality-Monitoring
This project is focused on the development of a low-cost air quality sensor. It aims to create a comprehensive system combining hardware, web interface, and design elements to monitor air quality in real-time.


This repository is organized into two main components:

Web: Contains the code for the web application that interfaces with the sensor, allowing users to view air quality data.
Hardware and Design: Contains schematics, PCB designs, and hardware-related code for sensor operation and data collection.
